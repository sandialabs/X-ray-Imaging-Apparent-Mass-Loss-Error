This directory contains all scripts required to replicate the findings of the
stainless steel detonator fragments in the work "Sub-resolution modeling of the
apparent mass loss in quantitative broadband X-ray radiography".

The MATLAB scripts are to be run in the order s01, s02, s03, s04. The .MAT
files TtoEPL contains the calibration data to convert transmission values to
equivalent path length, and fragments_norm contains the experimental stainless
steel fragment images that have been already normalized by a flat X-ray field.
